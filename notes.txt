Mar 7th
- Setup Git repo for this project (done)
- Install Coil with QZFM into Mini-MSR (done)
- Check zeroing (done)
- Write/Adapt simultaneous cell and coil measurement. (done)
- Check cell is responding, by moving screw driver nearer at 90 percent (done)

Mar 8th
- Finish soldering connections (done)
- Connect AWG, test AWG is working by seeing if sine wave can be seen (no)
- connect awg directly into labjack to see if signal is being outputted (initially no, but now yes with changed adapter)
- got additional adapter (done)
- check if sine wave can be seen now (yes)
- put on second layer ()
 
Mar 11th
- measure 0-10nT pp at 162 Hz (done)
- measure 0-10nT pp at 50 Hz (done)
- potential beating effect, notch filter 60 in analysis
- frequency sweep between 1 and 500 Hz over 100 seconds, big amplitude variations
- try sweep without highpass filter
- definitely there is a frequency dependence

Mar 12th
- Overall goal: to fully automate everything
1. get multimeter working (done)
2. figure out getting reading from multimeter in python (done)
3. figure out how to communicate with Rigol (done)
4. test outputting waves with Rigol (done)
5. write main script (done)
6. Take measurement for 35 Hz (done)

Mar 13th
- take measurement for 200 Hz
- Edit existing csv file to convert Vamp to Vpp (done)
- Write function to automatically create folder (done)
- iterate through frequencies between 20-100 Hz (done)
- clean y axis coil (done)
- solidworks model for x axis coil (done)
- print x axis coil (in print)
- change analysis code to be curve fit quadratic

Mar 14th
- take off MSR door, install y coil (done)
- clean x coil (done)
- put wire on x coil (done)
- measure freq 3, 10 without highpass
- measure 35, 50, 100, 200 with highpass
-> big problem, the amplitude in y seems to consistently higher
- install x coil
- measure 35, 50, 200 with highpass for x 
- lab report

Mar 15th
3 measurements, really detailed, at 40 Hz, 100 data points per, 4 seconds of quspin reading per

Mar 18th
- take off MSR door (done)
- put away sensor AAL9 (done)
- unpack sensor AAY4 and install in (done)
- measure sweep, x, y, z
